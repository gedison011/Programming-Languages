**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**
This project was to create a svaings function for a banking app called Airgead. The function calculates savings based on initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years.
**What did you do particularly well?**
Particulary well, I managed to format the output in a professional manner.
**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
Right now this code is a concept in its design. It doesnt hold any authentication perameters hwoever, if implimented to the banking app, I could add some level of authenticity to make private the information added to it through the banking app.
**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
I found creating the functions a challenge because they had to be calculated through user input first before being implemented into the expressions.
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
I think the skills in making functions to be the most transferrable aspect to this because a lot of it is somewhat generic and can be changed or moded based on the prject requirements.
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I made the progam maintainable by keeping the code in blocks to help decrypt bugs and identify them faster. I it s readable more-so by the comments on each aspect of the code. My functions can be changed by changing the functions calculated for interest to whatever the client desires.
